## Pause Docker Desktop

- You can pause your Docker Desktop session when you are not actively using it and save CPU resources on your machine. 
- When you pause Docker Desktop, the Linux VM running Docker Engine is paused, the current state of all your containers are saved in memory, and all processes are frozen. This reduces the CPU usage and helps you retain a longer battery life on your laptop. You can resume Docker Desktop when you want by clicking the Resume option.

- From the Docker menu, selectwhale menu and then Pause to pause Docker Desktop.
- Docker Desktop displays the paused status on the Docker menu and on the Containers, Images, Volumes, and Dev Environment screens in Docker Dashboard. You can still access the Preferences (or Settings if you are a Windows user) and the Troubleshoot menu from the Dashboard when youâ€™ve paused Docker Desktop.
- Select whale menu then Resume to resume Docker Desktop.
