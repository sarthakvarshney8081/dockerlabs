</table>

## Pre-requisite

#### Trying help commands for subcommands
Even you can try help for docker subcommands also
```
$ docker-compose build --help
Build or rebuild services.

Services are built once and then tagged as `project_service`,
e.g. `composetest_db`. If you change a service's `Dockerfile` or the
contents of its build directory, you can run `docker-compose build` to rebuild it.

Usage: build [options] [--build-arg key=val...] [SERVICE...]

Options:
    --compress              Compress the build context using gzip.
    --force-rm              Always remove intermediate containers.
    --no-cache              Do not use cache when building the image.
    --pull                  Always attempt to pull a newer version of the image.
    -m, --memory MEM        Sets memory limit for the build container.
    --build-arg key=val     Set build-time variables for services.
    --parallel              Build images in parallel.
```
