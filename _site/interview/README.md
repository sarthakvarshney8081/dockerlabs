# Behaviour Interview Questions Samples 

## Introducing STAR Method

The STAR method is a technique of answering behavioral interview questions in a structured manner by describing a specific situation, task, action, and result of the situation you are discussing. The STAR method helps you explain in a simple yet powerful way how you handled specific work situations and challenges.

The STAR format stands for Situation, Task, Action, Result:

- Situation: An event, project, or challenge faced
- Task: Your responsibilities and assignments for the situation
- Action: Steps or procedure taken to relieve or rectify situation
- Result: Results of actions taken.

## Example #1:  Tell me about a time when you performed well under enormous pressure.


## Step 1. 

Using the STAR method to answer this question, we’ll first start with describing the situation:

 

One time, at my last job, my coworker had a family emergency and needed to miss work for some time, and their super-important project was left unfinished and without a manager.

 

## Step 2. 

Next, we’ll give them the task:

 

My supervisor instructed me to take on the project, and with no leniency on the deadline, I had days to complete a project that originally should have taken several weeks.

 

## Step 3. 

Then the action taken to solve the problem:

 

I requested and was granted a reduction in my weekly goals, allotting me more time to attack the special project. As far as my weekly goals, I was able to delegate them out evenly to some of my teammates.

 

## Step 4. 

And finally, the result of your actions:

 

With the reduction in my daily goals, I was able to dedicate more time to the special project. This allowed me to finish it on time and with complete accuracy. My supervisor appreciated my attitude and drive, and I was given several more projects after that, along with an eventual promotion and pay raise.
